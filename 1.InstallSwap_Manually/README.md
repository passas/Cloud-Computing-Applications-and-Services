# Abstract
When we want to deploy an app, we tend to follow some steps. Those steps are ussually the dependency packages, install and maintenance. Furthermore, we do install our target application software.

An application software deployment comes with a panoply of setting behaviors, as long as proper configuration.

The very first step in order to gain control of our needs, it's to place a manual deployment ourselves.

# 1. Introduction
For this lesson we'll take an open-source application, it's called "Swap". Its intend it is to be a manager for the student schedules, as long as the teachers schedules. Find more information about it on https://github.com/Hackathonners/swap .

# 2. Pre-requisites
For this particular deployment task, we need the providence of 2 virtual machines from our IaaS provider.

We'll work with node1, ```192.168.56.101```, and node2, ```192.168.56.102```.

For the matter of this deployment, it's all we have to know.

# 3. Deployment
For the deployment of our app, we decide to indulge it on two different machines.

The first machine is intended to run the app database.
> ```192.168.56.101```

The second machine is intended to run the http app requests.
> ```192.168.56.102```

## 3.1 Database
Remember that this is a practice to load an empty machine. It has its Operative System, and nothing more.

### Install MySQL Server
Straightforward.
```
sudo apt install mysql-server
```

### Create, and manage the Swap database
Lunch the mysql server app.
```
sudo mysql
```

Manage to create the desired database.
```
CREATE DATABASE swap;
```

Open the database to a specific user, from a specific machine.
```
CREATE USER 'miguel'@'192.168.56.102' IDENTIFIED BY 'passinhas';
```
> ```miguel``` stands for my username;
> 
> ```192.168.56.102``` stands for the machine that will run the http requests;
> 
> ```passinhas``` stands for my password.

Work on its privileges.
```
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON swap.* TO 'miguel'@'192.168.56.102' WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

### Configure the database
State where the requests shall be listened.

Open the following file with a bash editor.
```
sudo vi /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
```
Search through the following configuration, and state that this node will be responsible for listening database requests.
```
bind-address            = 192.168.56.101
```
> ```192.168.56.101``` stands for the machine that will run the mysql dtabase requests.

Make it count.
```
sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart
```

## 3.2 App
In order to understand its requirements, we shall read the authors README. We can find that in the public repository: https://github.com/Hackathonners/swap .

There it states the following set of requirements:
- PHP 7.4+;
- PostgreSQL;
- Composer;
- NodeJS;
- Yarn.
