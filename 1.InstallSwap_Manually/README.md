# Abstract
When we want to deploy an app, we tend to follow some steps. Those steps are ussually the dependency packages, install and maintenance. Furthermore, we do install our target application software.

An application software deployment comes with a panoply of setting behaviors, as long as proper configuration.

The very first step in order to gain control of our needs, it's to place a manual deployment ourselves.
